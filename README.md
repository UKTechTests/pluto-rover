# pluto-rover
A programming challenge about making a rover move

### Setup

To install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Tests
To run the tests
```bash
npm test
```
This will also give coverage results from the files tested, look in `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` for more information about the coverage tests


## Further work

More tests are needed to properly specify the behavior of the rover colliding into things.

Also the world the rover moves on is not exactly spherical as it wraps around a square plane.
